# Customer Segmentation

## Summary
Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce company that connects small businesses to a larger marketplace. It gives these small businesses a way to manage their products, shipping, and online payments. They have approximately 200,000 users in about 180 countries.

With any online retailer, retaining customers is key but knowing who may leave and who stays could be guesswork.  Understanding how and why customers stay and shop and why they leave is pivotal to a company’s business.

Knowing who your customers are and how and why they shop or do not return plays a big part in customer service which ultimately enhances a customer’s satisfaction level. A high satisfaction level could lead to overall better reviews and with these good reviews, their sellers will see more new sales.
